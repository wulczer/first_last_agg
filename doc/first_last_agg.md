Description
-----------

This library contains two simple aggregate functions, `first` and
`last`, operating on any element type. They return the first or the
last value of the aggregated group, respectively.

It is useful with aggregates with `order by`, for easily taking one
element from an aggregate group when you don't really care which do
you get and for emulating a similar functionality from Oracle.
